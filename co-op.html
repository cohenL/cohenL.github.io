                	The first project I was given druing my co-op was to create a logo for a company called LeadFeast. I was given the instructions to make it look high tech and the rest I had freedom of choice. I really enjoyed this task becaue it gave me a lot of free range of what I wanted the design to look like and let me creatively think and make my own designs. I created many designs and ran it through my supervisers to determine which would look best for the company.

                <p class="">
                	After we determined the base design of the logo I was given the task to create different crations of the logo with different colours for the letters aswell as have different shapes around the logo. I created many different variations of the logo, but my supervisors went with the blue colors and a circle around the logo. I did final adjustments to the design such as making the colour of the full name a lighter blue to stand out more and was then finished with the task.

                	The next project I was given I found it much more difficult to create a design. I was given the task to create a logo for the company Genesis Labs, I was told to have some sort of tech or engineering in the design. I found it  difficult to create a good design that I like and thought would be appropiate for the company. I eventually came up with a design, but I did not like the way it looked. I took it up with my supervisor and he told me to talk to a designe who was a designer at Carleton Univeristy. She suggested I read some articles and books as well as watch a doccumentary on becoming more creative.

                <p class="">
                	After I took a break from designing and learned how to creatively think, I designed a initial design but did not like the colours. I asked what my supervisor thought and he liked the overall designer except for a few small adgustments and suggested I try a bunch of colour combinations and see what jumps out to me. I tried out many different colour combinations and liked a few of them but the design in the bottom right was what I thought looked the best. I asked what my supervior thought and he really liked the designh as well.

                	After creating the logo for Genesis Labs I was given the task to modify the logo for the holidays over the year. I really enjoyed this task because it gave me a lot of creative freedom. I could put what I wanted in each design for each of the holidays. This was a really fun and enjoyable project to complete.
