                	Initially at the beginning of the unit, the class practiced using premier pro to animate objects, this helped prepare us for the upcoming project where we would have to animate our logos. I chose to animate a wrecking ball hitting a stack of bricks and have them get pushed by the ball. This taught me many things about animating using premier pro, so I could apply my knowledge to the project.

                <p class="">
                	Before creating rough drafts for my logo I looked at various companies and personal logos and I found that many logos had a hidden message or hidden letter inside theirs. I wanted to somehow implement that into one of my logos. I created various rough sketches on how I could create certain letters in my name using the rest of the letters, I found that I could create an inside “N” using the C and L. The N would represent my middle name and the C and L would be my first and last names. I then searched for a font that could be best used to create the letter and found the font  "Yozakura". I then wrote my C and L, shifted them closer together and put a period in the middle to convey the letter I imagined. Along with the design of the logo, I had the plan to animate the N turning red so the hidden message would be clear. This is also conveyed in the red text of my middle name.

                <p class="">
                	When searching for logos I found one that shifted some of their letters around to look abstract and I found that with my name many of the letters have the same rounded top so I could try something similar. I decided to use the font “Edition” due to the letters not having serif, the rounded top was the same for each letter and I liked the style of the font. I then created 2 text boxes with a mask on each of them, one covering the bottom half of one of the text and the other covering the top half. I then was able to shift each side of the text to convey it being cut in half. I tried many styles, moving only some of the letters or all of them, but ended up moving all of the bottom letters to the left by the same amount. While the overall look is interesting and a little artistic, it becomes harder to read.

                <p class="">
                	For the next logo I decided to keep it basic and have big clear letters at the top as my logo with the rest of my name underneath. I tried my initials, and the first letter of either my first or last name, but decided that it looked best with my full initials. I still wanted to have some kind of design in my overall image, so I wanted to have the letters unique in some way. I went through many fonts that had their own unique looks but I went with “Pasajero” as my font of choice due to it being the most unique looking and also having a good aesthetically pleasing design. I then experimented with removing parts of the letters to give a more abstract look, while ensuring it was still legible to the familiar shape of the letters.

                <p class="">
                	For my final design I wanted to keep it simple but still have a nice looking logo and have a unique look. I saw some logos that had cursive in it so I wanted to try to incorporate cursive writing into this design. I wanted to keep my initials in the overall design, so I decided to have my initials in cursive and have my full name underneath in regular text. I looked through many cursive fonts and found that I liked the font “Madonna” the most. I decided to have the first 2 letters in lowercase and have the last letter of my initials in uppercase which makes it much larger and allows my printed name to be within the script initials. I was able to connect the cn and L all together by editing it and moving the L lower to create space for my name to go through the L in order to have a more unique look. I chose for the lower case letters to have the font as “cochin”.

                	I created a few other designs trying to find the perfect one, to use for my final logo and my animation. In the end I chose the 4th design as I liked it the most and thought it followed the criteria very well. I was satisfied with my decison and began the animation process
